# Report Groups No Members

This form lists AD groups with no members. (It does not delete groups because there may be other issues, e.g., nested groups, which must be manually resolved first.)

## Business Benefits

This form can list groups with no members without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD, security is improved.
